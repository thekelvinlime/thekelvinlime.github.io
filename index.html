        <h1>GET TO KNOW ME</h1>
        <p>
          I am a first-year MS in Computer Science student at Northeastern
          University. Previously, I earned a BS in Mechanical Engineering at the
          University of Texas. I live in Bellevue, WA and am currently looking
          for a software engineering internship for the Summer of 2023. I am
          very much into hiking mountains, climbing walls of rocks, and admiring
          the great outdoors.

        <h1>Northeastern University</h1>
        <h2>M.S. in Computer Science, to be earned May 2024</h2>
        <p>
          Northeastern University has been a breath of fresh air. As a member of
          the ALIGN program on the Seattle campus, I have met a large variety of
          working professionals in the process of looking for a career change
          into the tech space. I have met biologists, army veterans, financial
          consultants, and architects. Together, many of us have worked together
          on multitudes of projects and have fostered close friendships as
          peers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am looking forwards to building new applications, work on
          open-source projects, and finding a software development engineer
          internship for the Summer of 2023.

        <h1>University of Texas</h1>
        <h2>B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, earned May 2019</h2>
        <p>
          The University of Texas at Austin was a campus full of new and diverse
          opportunities. The years I spent meeting cool professors, working on
          projects with real-world applications, and connecting with new friends
          in my discipline have pushed me far beyond my comfort zone and helped
          broaden my perspective and worldview.
        </p>
        <p>
          My contributions to research on heat exchangers have shown me that
          education, when applied, is the most powerful tool. With the knowledge
          I gained from classes, self-research, and building and modifying an
          outdoor A/C unit cooler to fit small aircrafts have made me the
          inquisitive person I am today.
        </p>
        <p>
          The University of Texas showed me how much I love engineering in
          general, gifted me with the passion to pursue ideas that I find
          worthwhile, and surrounded me with a wealth of inspiring peers.

        <h1>Little Bit Therapeutic Riding Center</h1>
        <h2>Volunteer, during October 2019 thru March 2020</h2>
        <p>
          Volunteering at the riding center opened my eyes to the how innovative
          therapy can become. At theriding center, sick riders and patients ride
          horses to help speed up the strengthening and bettering of hip
          movement. This allows them to perform their daily activities more like
          regular people.
        </p>
        <p>
          While grooming and tacking the horses before each volunteering
          session, supporting riders during each class session, and putting away
          the horses, I have met and made new friends who love horses and love
          helping kids. Seeing the smile etched across the faces of each
          individual rider has brought me great joy.
